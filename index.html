  <h1>Beyond Bars: The Power of Education in Prison</h1>
  <p1>By: Ana Luque & Leila Minkara</p1>

  <div class="title">
    <p>Each year in the United States, over 600,000 people are discharged from state and federal prisons, with an additional nine million released from local jails. Within three years post-release, the majority of ex-prisoners—two out of three—are rearrested, and more than half end up back behind bars. This phenomenon, where previously convicted individuals commit new offenses and return to the prison system, is recognized as recidivism.</p>
  </div>

<div id="slide5" class="slide header">
  <p1>The recidivism crisis in the United States surpasses that of other democratic nations with similar economic standings. If the “lessons” claimed by correctional workers were actually taught, then the recidivism rate would not be as high as it is. The nation's elevated recidivism rate shows the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of prisons, highlighting the urgent need for a reimagined criminal justice system. </br>
    To foster successful reintegration and to decrease recidivism rates, the key lies in rehabilitation. Offering comprehensive rehabilitation programs is the straightforward solution to prepare people for life outside prison. 
    Unfortunately, in states like Massachusetts a lot of the people that are incarcerated are very young, most of them are in their 20s and early 30s and usually tend to be reincarcerated due to the lack of resources given to them in and outside the prison system. </br>
   </br>
  Systemic barriers to education and marginalization within the American educational system contribute to the entrapment of young people of color in the criminal justice system from their early school years. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the "school-to-prison" pipeline. Which limits the paths individuals can take in their formative years. 
  In prison there is usually no form of rehabilitation or system where people in the system can learn new skills or get an education. This is usually because a lot of private prisons make profit from keeping recidivism rates high. Many businesses have noticed the potential of labor that can be found inside prisons, since overworking people behind bars is cheaper. Companies such as Walmart, AT&T, etc., benefit from prison and their lack of reformation as it will keep “free” laborers coming back. 
  For example, things such as college beds and desks come from prison labor, and it is work that does not benefit them at all. It is repetitive, tiring, and only frustrates people and does not offer them skills that could help with smoother reintegration into society.

    Fortunately, there are educational programs offered in some prisons that allow people that are incarcerated to get a college education. One of these programs is Emerson College’s EPI or Emerson’s Prison Initiative non-profit that provides college courses to those incarcerated in Massachusetts. According to their website EPI is “operated at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Concord (MCI-Concord) from 2017 to 2023 and since 2023, operates at MCI-Norfolk. Both are men’s medium-security prisons. EPI acts on the knowledge that college-in-prison programs can help stop the cycle of incarceration.”  </br>
   </br>
    EPI students are subject to identical achievement standards and general education prerequisites as their peers in Emerson College's BA program. Their academic performance undergoes similar evaluation, considering factors such as course grades, curricular scaffolding, and degree completion. Following an in-depth accreditation procedure with the New England Commission of Higher Education in 2021, MCI-Concord attained approval as a degree-granting campus affiliated with Emerson College.
    
    EPI was founded by professor Mneesha Gellman back in 2017, and through her hard work she has been able to see the success of the program. “I am the founder of the program. I created it. It did not exist at the college and I created it from scratch. And now, I am the director. My full-time job is as a professor at Emerson College and so I run EPI as my service on the side of my regular job,” says Gellman.

    <p>“[In 2017] EPI admitted the first cohort of twenty students to EPI and also to Emerson College. When someone applies and is accepted to EPI, they become an admitted student of the college. And those students matriculated into a B.A. pathway to work towards their B.A. in media, literature and culture. And so, the program began in 2017, we have now admitted three cohorts of twenty students each and we graduated our first cohort last fall in 2022.”</br>

    <p>“Yes, EPI is costly, complex, and sometimes involves discomfort and risk. But we can take pride in knowing that at this difficult moment – a time that calls for social justice and demands a difficult reckoning with the past and its ongoing structural consequences – Emerson College has heard the call, stepped up, and done the right thing.” </br>

  <p2>Emerson College is not the only college that has their own prison initiative. There are others such as BPI (Bard Prison Initiative), TUPIT (Tufts University Prison Initiative of Tisch College), and many others that share similar goals with EPI. College education programs like this go a long way in the prison system. </br>
    There have been many studies that show that college education, as well as other educational initiatives like vocational school, have reduced recidivism rates. A study published in the American Journal of Criminal Justice showed that college education reduced recidivism rates by 13 percent. Other studies have shown that once people who were incarcerated have access to even higher education, such as a masters degree, the recidivism rates reach 0. </br>

    <p1>So far, non-profit organizations like this help not only the people who are imprisoned but also other college students. Many of these colleges and universities, such as Emerson College, offer a one-credit, non-tuition class where students can attend and learn more about the program as well as the prison system in the United States. By doing this, the college encourages its students to participate in the program and spread the word about prison rehabilitation. </br>
    </br>
      Including college programs in prisons has been proven to be a big step forward to reduce the current mass of incarceration and recidivism rates, it is still not enough. As long as private prisons exist and rehabilitation programs are not implemented in every prison across the United States, recidivism and mass incarceration rates will continue to increase in states and prisons where college programs are not offered.
